# GIS-Dissertation
All code used in the completion of the Master's dissertation thesis, "Modeling Water Quality in the Lower Mekong Basin: Land Use and Macroinvertebrates as Proxy Indicators".

All filed were created and run in R version 4.4.2 (R Core Team 2024).

The working directory should be updated and set before running any code to ensure file paths are correct.

Files should be run in the order of their naming conventions (i.e. 1_wfs_extraction.R, 2_shp_processing.R, etc.).
